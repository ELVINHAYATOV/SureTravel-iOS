# SureTravel

## What is SureTravel?
SureTravel is an idea that aims to increase appeal of citizens to buy life insurance. We believe that providing award mechanism into Insurance system by integrating yearly health goals will increase peoples motivation to usage of life insurance. We will come up with some workshops and holidays inside or outside of country. The users which can stay healthy up to targeted year will have a chance to get benefit from these events. **Only the health issues that can affect to the life Insurance will included.**

### How SureTravel will implement this idea?
