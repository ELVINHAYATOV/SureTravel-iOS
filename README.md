# SureTravel

This is a project idea for USG Apex Hackathon by Pathfinders team. 


## Our team

We are **Pathfinders** team and we want to make corporate life insurance more attractive for customers.


## Project Description

SureTravel is our idea which aims to increase appeal of citizens to buy life insurance. We believe that providing award mechanism into insurance system by integrating yearly health goals will increase peoples motivation to usage of life insurance.

We will come up with some workshops and holidays inside or outside of country. The users who will be able to stay healthy till the targeted year will have a chance to get benefit from these events. **Only the health issues that can affect the life Insurance will be considered.**

We have made an MVP for this idea on IOS platform. This feature will show different events to the users and the users that reach the target year will easily apply for these programs.


## Main features

- Easy Access from current «Pasha Life» mobile application
- Progress bar for tracking healthy days' duration
